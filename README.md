## Design

### Color Scheme

I have chosen to keep the webpage mostly white like gallery walls. This is to draw attention to the work and not to distract the user. This was a joint decision with the artist. I chose the dark earthy green for the logo as I felt this would compliment the earthy tones in his landscape pictures.

### Font Choices 

I wanted to contrast a modern font, which I've used for the headings with traditional fonts for the logo and the paragraphs.

![paragraph](media/docs/paragraph-font.png)

### Error Handling

### Defensive Programming

#### User

I have used "@login_required" to prevent users from accessing some pages. This prevents those not logged in from accessing the admin pages.

#### Admin User

I have used if statements in the templates to prevent non-superusers from accessing the admin pages.

I have set up AWS to prevent others from accessing keys and being able to write to the media and static buckets.

# Deployment

The site has been developed using Gitpod workspaces and Github for version control. It was deployed to Heroku using the following steps:

* Log in to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login), using two factor authentication
* Click New and Create New App
* Choose a name and select the closest reigon
* Click Create App

Create a database to store the website data:

* Login to [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/)
* Create new instance
* Set up your plan - Give the plan a name and select Tiny Turtle free plan
* Choose the closest reigon (EU-West-1(Ireland))
* Click Review
* Click Create instance
* Return to elephantsql dashboard, click on database instance name
* In the url section, clicking the copy icon will copy the database url to the clipboard
* Go back to Heroku to your created app, go to Settings
* Add config var DATABASE-URL, and for the value, copy in your databse url from ElephantSQL
* In Gitpod install dj-database_url and psycopg2 to connect to your external database
* Update requirements.txt: pip freeze > requirements
* import dj_database_url in settings and update your database
* migrate your database
* create a new superuser for your database (do not push to github until complete)
* Install gunicorn and freeze into the requirements file
* Then create Procfile and add config var DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
* Commit and push to github
* Use the CLI to connect the repo to heroku and deploy, set automatic deployment
* When complete click View to open the deployed app
