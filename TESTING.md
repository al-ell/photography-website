## BUGS

### Solved Bugs

| Bug | How I solved the issue | Image |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| The price wouldn't change on selection of the options on print info page | selected_size was not in the model, after renaming "prints_size" it began to work | ![bag bug](media/docs/bug-getting-price-from-size.png) |
| Items would not add to the bag as the prints category was expecting to be a string but was instead an integer | This was happening because the category model in the shop is directly taken from the project model in the project app. Adding  an "__name"" allowed access to the name | ![bag bug](media/docs/bug-bag-int.png) |
| Delivery fee showing when the bag is empty | added "elif" to make delivery 0 when bag total is 0 | ![bag bug](media/docs/bug-basket-0.png) |
| The remove from bag link wasn't working | I was targeting the wrong value in my HTML, missing the "_" from remove. Once added it worked immediately | ![bag bug](media/docs/bug-remove-typo.png) |
| The update bag link wasn't updating the bag quantity of an item | The JQuery was targeting the previous element, but the previous element was the remove button. Once I swapped them it worked immediately | ![bag bug](media/docs/bug-js-prev.png) |
| The webhook was failing | I forgot to update the webhook endpoint when switching to the new student account |  |
| The burger menu wasn't showing in the nav on a smaller screen | I moved it to be in the list with the other icons, and to hide on larger screens |  |
| The print price and line subtotal wasn't updating in the bag depending on the size chosen | I added if/else statements to show the correct prices on the template |  |
| The delivery fee was still showing if the basket was empty | I updated the if/else statement to include a condition to set the delivery fee to 0 if the basket was empty |  |
| Stripe not working | I forgot to update the stripe endpoint when I ported my workspace |  |
| Category name isn't showing on print edit page | I forgot to add a string method to the model when I recreated it. |  |
| 500 server error on deployed site when trying to delete anyting in the shop | I was targeting the wrong template in the views, updating it made it work |  |
| Unable to create account | Missing "{% load i18n %}" from email subject txt file | |
