                    Throughout my life I have been surrounded by the idea that the Welsh identity, sense of heritage and 
                    culture was under threat and at risk of being lost. Partnered with that, there has always been a quiet 
                    sense of feeling less than others, an underdog mentality, and an inner tension of having been done wrong 
                    somehow in the past.<br>
                    Wales was conquered by England in 1282, marking the end of Welsh Independence, and putting the 
                    country high in the running for the title of England’s first colony. Over the next seven hundred years 
                    followed a long series of settlement, subjugation, forced assimilation, exploitation and discrimination. 
                    These systematic attempts to subdue Wales and its people have left a mark on the culture, landscape 
                    and national psyche. <br>
                    Although pushed to the western edges of the UK, Ireland and France, a small Celtic speaking minority 
                    has remained along the fringes of the continent, wedged between the mountains and the sea. It is in 
                    one of these areas, known as ‘Y Fro Gymraeg’, that the language of Welsh is still spoken and remains 
                    a part of everyday life. It is in this area the traditions, myths and culture still stand strong, for now. 
                    This land is criss-crossed with constant reminders of our place as second-class citizens throughout 
                    time. English castles dominate our towns, the remnants of extractive industry blight our hillsides,
                     and our coastal villages lay empty for most of the year, fallen victim to holiday homes, while 
                     local people want for houses. <br>
                    With little opportunities to be found here, the inhabitants of this area mainly work in care, 
                    construction, services or tourism, catering for the needs of new, wealthier incomers from across the 
                    border. Each year, in the struggle to sustain ourselves, we lose a little more of who we are. We are a 
                    land and people defined by the oppression of our larger neighbour, now forced to live in its shadow, and 
                    the shadow cast is long and wide.
